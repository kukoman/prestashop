# prestashop 1.7.5

Just adding some config files and changes I had to make for shitty prestashop 1.7.5 to make it run:
- php 7.3
- mariadb 10.3
- nginx 1.15.8
- pagespeed
- caching
- local CDN (img.[domain].tld)

Hope it will help someone from pulling their hairs as I did... and I thought Wordpress was crap...
